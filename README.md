# DiamonPrediction_EndtoEnd_ML_Project
 Diamond Price Prediction  Welcome to the Diamond Price Prediction project repository! This project aims to predict the price of diamonds using machine learning techniques. Leveraging a dataset containing various features such as carat weight, cut, color, clarity, and depth, we've developed robust predictive models to estimate diamond prices accurately.  Key Features:  Data Exploration: Explore the characteristics of diamond features and their correlations with pricing. Training Pipeline: Develop and optimize machine learning models using a dedicated training pipeline. This pipeline includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and hyperparameter tuning to ensure optimal performance. Prediction Pipeline: Deploy trained models for real-time price prediction using a separate prediction pipeline. This pipeline enables seamless integration of models into production environments, providing valuable insights to diamond sellers and buyers alike. Evaluation Metrics: Assess model performance using industry-standard metrics to ensure accuracy and reliability. Interactive Visualization: Visualize model predictions and insights to gain a deeper understanding of diamond pricing trends. Scalable Deployment: Deploy trained models for real-time price prediction, providing valuable insights to diamond sellers and buyers alike. Contributing: Contributions are welcome! Whether you're interested in improving model performance, enhancing data visualization, extending the functionality of the training or prediction pipelines, or adding new features, your contributions are highly appreciated. Please feel free to fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.  Usage:  Clone the repository to your local machine. Install the required dependencies specified in the requirements.txt file. Run the provided Jupyter notebooks or scripts to explore the data, train models using the training pipeline, and deploy models for real-time predictions using the prediction pipeline.
